# ðŸ“– Introduction
Welcome to my **30-day CAD Challenge** â€” a dedicated repository for daily modeling tasks and projects throughout **June 2025**, focused on mastering **Computer-Aided Design (CAD)**. This initiative is part of my broader journey to become a **world-class mechanical systems designer and product engineer**.

Each task explores principles of mechanical design, modeling precision, and digital fabrication using industry-standard tools like SolidWorks, Fusion 360, or AutoCAD. 

This repository documents my commitment to mastering two high-impact technical domains:
Backend Development and Computer-Aided Design (CAD).

This challenge represents more than daily practice â€” it's a strategic journey to:

Engineer scalable backend systems using modern development stacks.

Model precise, production-ready mechanical components with industry-standard CAD tools.

Every day of this challenge is intentionally designed to bridge software logic and mechanical design thinking, with the end goal of building solutions that are not only functional but manufacturable â€” a synergy crucial for full-stack system builders and product engineers.

Whether you're a fellow developer, aspiring engineer, or tech enthusiast, this repository offers a transparent look into daily problem-solving, technical growth, and real-world applications of backend and CAD skills.

## ðŸ§  Goals

- Build a solid foundation in **3D modeling and design**.
- Practice and document daily CAD exercises and real-world parts.
- Gain fluency with **SolidWorks**, **Fusion 360**, and **AutoCAD**.
- Move closer to becoming a **CAD expert and mechanical systems innovator**.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This 30-day challenge represents a focused push toward my goal of becoming a **skilled mechanical designer and product engineer**, capable of translating ideas into manufacturable components.
- Each day's model is more than just a drawing â€” it's a **step toward understanding real-world mechanical systems**, tolerances, assemblies, and design intent.
- Daily progress will include:
  - Project/model folder
  - CAD files (`.SLDPRT`, `.STEP`, `.F3D`, etc.)
  - Screenshots or render previews
  - Key design notes or observations
- Feedback and collaboration are encouraged:
  - Open an issue with suggestions
  - Submit a pull request to contribute
  - Share ideas or improvements â€” Iâ€™m open to learning with the community

> Every sketch, revolve, and extrude brings me closer to design mastery.

## ðŸ“… Challenge Overview

For 30 days, I will:
- **Build, document, and push daily backend projects** using technologies like Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and RESTful APIs.
- **Design and model mechanical parts** using CAD tools like SolidWorks, Autodesk Fusion 360, or FreeCAD.
- Share key takeaways, progress, and improvements on a daily basis.
