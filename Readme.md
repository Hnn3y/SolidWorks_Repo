# 🧩 30-Days of CAD Design — with Techyjaut

## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to my **30-Day CAD Challenge**, a focused initiative for **June 2025** to master **Computer-Aided Design (CAD)** through hands-on modeling, precision design, and mechanical systems thinking.

This repository is solely dedicated to **CAD-related work** and is part of a broader dual-track journey — alongside [my backend development challenge](https://github.com/Hnn3y/30-Days_with_Techyjaut) — to become a **world-class software engineer and mechanical product designer**.

Here, I dive into **real-world design practices** using industry-standard tools like **SolidWorks**, **Fusion 360**, and **AutoCAD**, combining principles of form, function, manufacturability, and performance.

> This challenge isn’t just about modeling — it’s about building a design mindset.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop **daily 3D models** based on real mechanical components or conceptual parts.
- Strengthen proficiency with **SolidWorks**, **Fusion 360**, and **AutoCAD**.
- Master **parametric design**, **assemblies**, and **dimensioning best practices**.
- Build a digital portfolio showcasing both **technical skill** and **design thinking**.
- Move steadily toward my long-term goal of becoming a **CAD expert and mechanical systems innovator**.

---

## 🧠 Why This Challenge Matters

In a world where software powers everything from vehicles to robots, the **fusion of backend logic and mechanical design** is essential for full-system innovation. This CAD challenge is about:

- **Designing manufacturable mechanical components**
- Understanding how parts work in systems (fit, tolerance, function)
- Applying digital design for **prototyping, simulation, and production**

---

## 📅 Daily Workflow

Each day includes:

- 📐 A new CAD design or task
- 📎 Technical notes (e.g., design intent, tools used, constraints)
- 🖼️ Screenshots or renders of the model
- 📂 Structured folder for clean versioning

---

## 📌 Notes

- Models are designed for **learning**, **experimentation**, and **documentation** — not commercial use.
- File naming follows a clear format: `day-XX_component-name.extension`.
- Each part is based on engineering principles (dimensions, tolerances, usability).
- Models may reflect real-world components, simplified for practice.

> Every sketch, revolve, and mate brings me closer to production-ready mastery.
